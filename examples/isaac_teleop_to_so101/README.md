# Isaac Teleop → SO-101

Teleoperate an SO-101/SO-100 follower arm — and record LeRobot datasets — with NVIDIA
[Isaac Teleop](https://github.com/NVIDIA/IsaacTeleop). The input device is an **XR (VR)
controller**: its grip pose drives the end-effector through a squeeze-to-engage clutch and
LeRobot's Cartesian IK pipeline, and the analog trigger drives the gripper.

The full narrative guide (how the clutch works, CloudXR setup, headset pairing, tuning, and
troubleshooting) is in the [LeRobot docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/isaac_teleop)
(source: `docs/source/isaac_teleop.mdx`). This README is the canonical install and usage
reference.

## Requirements

- Linux workstation (see NVIDIA's
  [system requirements](https://nvidia.github.io/IsaacTeleop/main/references/requirements.html)
  for supported OS/GPU/headset combinations; `isaacteleop` publishes Linux wheels only).
- An SO-101 (or SO-100) follower arm, calibrated with `lerobot-calibrate`.
- A CloudXR-capable headset (e.g. Quest 3, Pico 4, Apple Vision Pro) on the same network.

## Installation

This example lives in the LeRobot repository and is not part of the `lerobot` pip package, so
work from a source checkout. From the repo root:

```bash
# The extras this example uses:
#   isaac-teleop - isaacteleop[cloudxr,retargeters-lite] + kinematics (Placo IK) + scipy
#   feetech      - SO-101 serial motor bus
#   dataset      - dataset recording (record.py)
# huggingface_hub >= 1.5 is needed by the automatic URDF fetch (Buckets API).
uv pip install -e ".[isaac-teleop,feetech,dataset]" "huggingface_hub>=1.5"
```

`isaacteleop` is pinned to the 1.5 line, which is currently a **pre-release** whose wheels
(manylinux only, glibc ≥ 2.35) are published on the NVIDIA index rather than public PyPI, which
carries a source distribution that does not build. `pyproject.toml` declares that index as
`nvidia` and routes only `isaacteleop` to it, so `uv` needs no extra flags; the extra is marked
`sys_platform == 'linux'`, so on macOS/Windows it resolves without `isaacteleop` (and the example
cannot run there). With plain `pip`, which does not read `[tool.uv]`, install it explicitly:

```bash
pip install "isaacteleop[cloudxr,retargeters-lite]~=1.5" \
    --extra-index-url https://pypi.nvidia.com --pre
```

One-time CloudXR EULA (the auto-launch prompts on stdin and would hang on a headless machine):

```bash
python -m isaacteleop.cloudxr --accept-eula
```

## Usage

Run everything from the repo root with `python -m` so the `examples` package resolves.

### Teleoperate

```bash
python -m examples.isaac_teleop_to_so101.teleoperate \
    --robot.type=so101_follower \
    --robot.port=/dev/ttyACM0 \
    --robot.id=so101_follower_arm
```

On startup the script launches the CloudXR runtime (~30 s), prints the workstation IP to enter in
the headset's CloudXR web client, waits for the controllers to stream, slews the arm to a reset
pose (`--reset_to_origin=false` to skip), and then: **hold the squeeze/grip** to engage, move the
controller to drive the arm, pull the trigger to close the gripper. Releasing the squeeze slews the
arm back to the reset pose and re-homes the clutch there, so the next squeeze starts from a known
pose. The SO-101 URDF is fetched automatically from the `lerobot/robot-urdfs` Hugging Face
bucket into the LeRobot cache on first run.

To customize the reset pose: back-drive the arm to the pose you want, then

```bash
python -m examples.isaac_teleop_to_so101.override_reset_pose \
    --robot.type=so101_follower --robot.port=/dev/ttyACM0 --robot.id=so101_follower_arm
```

which writes it to `HF_LEROBOT_HOME/reset_poses/<robot.name>/<robot.id>.json`; runs with the same
`--robot.id` use it automatically. It takes the same `--robot.*` arguments as `teleoperate.py`, so
it works for any arm with a profile.

### Teleoperate — XR controller on another arm

The XR path is not SO-101-specific. Any follower with a `RobotProfile` entry in `common.py` can be
driven from the same loop; the profile carries its URDF, IK frame, reach-derived bounds, reset pose,
gripper endpoints and clutch gain. It assumes the follower reports joints in the same convention
its URDF uses. The reBot B601-RS (RobStride motors, SocketCAN) ships as a profile:

```bash
python -m examples.isaac_teleop_to_so101.teleoperate \
    --robot.type=rebot_b601_rs_follower \
    --robot.port=can0 --robot.can_adapter=socketcan \
    --robot.id=rebot_arm
```

Its URDF (plus ~64 MB of meshes) is fetched from
[Seeed-Projects/reBot-Isaacsim](https://github.com/Seeed-Projects/reBot-Isaacsim) into the LeRobot
cache on first run; `REBOT_RS_URDF` points at a local copy instead. Being 6-DOF it tracks commanded
orientation fully (`orientation_weight=1.0`), unlike the 5-DOF SO-101's soft-orientation IK.

A profile may also set `clutch_position_scale`, the controller-to-EE translation gain — the reBot
reaches 0.911 m against the SO-101's 0.545 m, so it runs 1:1 where the device default halves hand
motion. Retune it in the profile, and keep `max_ee_step_m` above the per-frame EE step the new
gain produces — a larger gain means a hand sweep commands proportionally more EE travel per frame.

Before driving a **new** arm under torque, check its profile against the hardware: the reset pose
and bounds are derived from the URDF, and a follower whose joint signs disagree with its URDF
commands a mirrored pose. `rebot_readback.py` checks that against the arm with torque disabled,
and never calls `send_action`.

### Record a dataset

`record.py` takes the same `--robot.*`/`--teleop.*`/loop flags plus `lerobot-record`-style
`--dataset.*` flags:

```bash
python -m examples.isaac_teleop_to_so101.record \
    --robot.type=so101_follower --robot.port=/dev/ttyACM0 --robot.id=so101_follower_arm \
    --robot.cameras="{ front: {type: opencv, index_or_path: 0, width: 640, height: 480, fps: 30}}" \
    --dataset.repo_id=<hf_user>/<dataset_name> \
    --dataset.single_task="Pick up the cube" \
    --dataset.num_episodes=3 --dataset.episode_time_s=20 --dataset.reset_time_s=5
```

The clutch is the episode boundary: releasing the squeeze (after engaging it at least once) ends
and saves the episode, then the arm slews back to its reset pose during the reset window and the
clutch is re-homed there. One episode is one uninterrupted squeeze. `--reset_to_origin=false`
disables the slew (startup, declutch and between episodes alike).

Keyboard shortcuts (terminal-first, so they work over SSH): **Right/n** end episode early,
**Left/r** re-record, **Esc/q** stop after the current episode.

Run either script with `--help` for all flags.
